# Hotel-WebScrapper
It's a mini web scraper that collates hotel deals from various sources, which are then displayed to users based on their search criteria. We also claims to help users get the best rates by comparing  hotels across over 5 booking sites (We can increase it to over 250 sites in future). However, users can’t book via our application; they can only choose the hotel, after which they’re redirected to traditional online travel agencies (such as Priceline, Ctrip and Expedia). We can make our own e-wallet in the future, so the user can book a hotel directly from our application or we can create a combined wallet which uses the account of the particular customer which he has in the respective company.
